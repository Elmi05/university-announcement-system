## Supabase Implementation Strategy

### Database Design with RLS
**Tenant Isolation via Row Level Security:**
- Single database with `tenant_id` columns for data isolation
- RLS policies to ensure users only access their tenant's data
- Built-in user management with Supabase Auth
- Custom user metadata for role-based access

### Database Schema Structure
```sql
-- Core Tables
universities (tenant_id, name, domain, subscription_tier, created_at)
admin_users (id, university_id, email, role, created_at)
announcements (id, university_id, title, content, status, created_at)
subscription_usage (university_id, month_year, announcement_count)

-- Platform Management
platform_admins (id, email, role, created_at)
subscription_plans (id, name, announcement_limit, features)
```

### Authentication Flow
- **Platform Admins**: Custom authentication with platform-specific roles
- **University Admins**: Tenant-scoped authentication with university_id in metadata
- **RLS Policies**: Automatic tenant filtering based on JWT claims

### Edge Functions for Custom Logic
- University registration workflow
- Subscription tier enforcement
- Usage tracking and analytics
- Email notifications and alerts

### Real-time Features
- Live announcement updates
- Real-time usage limit notifications
- Dashboard metrics streaming
- Collaborative editing capabilities
