# Database Setup Instructions

Since your Supabase project is in read-only mode, you'll need to apply the database schema manually through the Supabase Dashboard.

## Steps to Set Up Your Database:

### 1. Open Supabase Dashboard
- Go to [https://supabase.com/dashboard](https://supabase.com/dashboard)
- Navigate to your project: `yhpjxkbyfbjblibmituf`

### 2. Access SQL Editor
- Click on "SQL Editor" in the left sidebar
- Click "New Query" to create a new SQL script

### 3. Copy and Run the Database Schema
Copy the entire contents of `database_schema.sql` and paste it into the SQL Editor, then click "Run".

This will create:
- **universities** table (for storing university information)
- **admin_users** table (for university administrators)  
- **announcements** table (for university announcements)
- Row Level Security policies for data isolation
- Sample data (Harvard and Stanford universities)

### 4. Verify Setup
After running the schema, you can verify it worked by running these queries:

```sql
-- Check if tables were created
SELECT table_name FROM information_schema.tables 
WHERE table_schema = 'public';

-- Check sample data
SELECT * FROM universities;
SELECT * FROM admin_users;
SELECT * FROM announcements;
```

### 5. Test the Application
Once the database is set up:
1. Make sure your frontend development server is running: `npm run dev`
2. Navigate to http://localhost:3000/
3. You should see the real data from Supabase instead of mock data

## What Changed in Phase 2:

✅ **Replaced Mock Data with Real Supabase Queries**
- `UniversityManagement` component now fetches data from Supabase
- `PlatformOverview` component shows real statistics
- All CRUD operations (Create, Read, Update, Delete) work with real database

✅ **Added Error Handling & Loading States**
- Loading spinners while fetching data
- Error messages with retry buttons
- Form submission states

✅ **Created University Service Layer**
- `universityService.ts` handles all Supabase operations
- Proper TypeScript interfaces
- Centralized error handling

## Features Now Working:
- ✅ Register new universities with admin accounts
- ✅ View all universities with real statistics 
- ✅ Edit university information
- ✅ Delete universities
- ✅ Real-time platform statistics
- ✅ Recent activity tracking
- ✅ Search and pagination
- ✅ Data validation and error handling

## Next Steps (Phase 3):
After the database is set up, we can proceed to:
- University admin login portals
- University-specific announcement management
- Enhanced analytics and reporting
- User authentication system
